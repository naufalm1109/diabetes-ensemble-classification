# Diabetes Ensemble Classification

This repository contains the implementation of **homogeneous** (Boosting, Bagging) and **heterogeneous** (Stacking, Blending) ensemble learning models for **diabetes mellitus classification**.  
The project compares model accuracy, training time, and memory usage to find the most efficient approach for diabetes risk prediction.

## ðŸ“– Overview
Diabetes mellitus is one of the fastest-growing chronic diseases globally. Early detection and classification play a crucial role in effective healthcare management.  
This project applies **ensemble learning techniques** to improve prediction performance by combining multiple models, making the system more robust compared to single classifiers.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Duplicate removal  
  - Handling missing values  
  - Feature transformation (categorical â†’ numeric)  
  - Data balancing using **SMOTE-Tomek**

- **Models Implemented**
  - **Homogeneous Ensembles**
    - Boosting (AdaBoost + RandomForest)
    - Bagging (RandomForest)
  - **Heterogeneous Ensembles**
    - Stacking (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, RandomForest as base learners, RF as meta-model)
    - Blending (similar to stacking but more efficient)

- **Evaluation Metrics**
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - Resource usage (training time & RAM)

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary
| Method     | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | RAM Usage | Training Time |
|------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Boosting   | 98%      | 0.98      | 0.97   | 0.98     | 2676 MB   | 386 s         |
| Bagging    | 97%      | 0.97      | 0.97   | 0.97     | 3888 MB   | 466 s         |
| Stacking   | 98%      | 0.99      | 0.97   | 0.98     | 155 MB    | 189 s         |
| Blending   | 98%      | 0.99      | 0.97   | 0.98     | 88 MB     | 37 s          |

âœ… **Blending** is the most efficient in terms of time & memory.  
âœ… **Stacking** offers a strong balance between performance & efficiency.
